 This place ain't doing me any good
      I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
      Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
      
      Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
      Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
      Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove
      Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
      Dont get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through
